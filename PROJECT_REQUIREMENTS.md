# Dev Workflow Orchestrator (DWO) - Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Dev Workflow Orchestrator (DWO)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Planning Phase  

### Executive Summary
Transform the existing production dashboard into an intelligent development workflow management platform that orchestrates parallel "experimental" development paths, enabling product teams to simultaneously explore multiple approaches to feature development, compare results, and optimize development outcomes through data-driven decision making.

## Core Concept

The Dev Workflow Orchestrator enables "parallel experimentation" in software development - where teams can:
1. Import a PRD or task specification
2. Generate multiple development approaches/variations automatically
3. Execute these approaches in parallel (different branches/environments)
4. Monitor, measure, and compare progress and outcomes
5. Make data-driven decisions about which approach to continue

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Epic 1: PRD Processing & Plan Generation
**As a** Product Manager  
**I want to** import a PRD and automatically generate multiple development approaches  
**So that** I can explore different implementation strategies efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System can parse standard PRD formats (Markdown, PDF)
- AI generates 3-5 distinct development approaches per major feature
- Each approach includes detailed task breakdown and success criteria
- Generated plans are editable and customizable
- Plans can be saved, versioned, and shared

### Epic 2: Parallel Development Orchestration
**As a** Development Team Lead  
**I want to** execute multiple experimental approaches simultaneously  
**So that** I can compare results and choose the best solution

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System creates isolated development environments for each approach
- Progress is tracked independently for each experimental path
- Resources are allocated and monitored across all experiments
- Teams can work on different approaches without interference
- Results can be compared in real-time

### Epic 3: Quality & Testing Management
**As a** QA Engineer  
**I want to** ensure all experimental paths maintain high quality standards  
**So that** any chosen approach is production-ready

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automated test generation for each experimental path
- Continuous quality monitoring and reporting
- Comparative quality metrics across approaches
- Automated alerts for quality degradation
- Test results influence path scoring and recommendations
